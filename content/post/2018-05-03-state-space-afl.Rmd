Ever read a post and went damn! I really wonder how that would work for AFL . 

Well that was me a couple of weeks ago reading this [fantastic post](http://statsbylopez.netlify.com/post/a-state-space-model-to-evaluate-sports-teams/) and as most people know a good post is a fantastic post when it is reproducible. 

```{r}

library(tidyverse) 
library(rjags)
library(gsheet)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)

logit <- function(p) { 
  out <- log(p/(1 - p))
  return(out)
}


```
