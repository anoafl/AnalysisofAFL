<p>We are now at the half-way point of what has been a most surprising season of footy.</p>
<p>Who would have thought the Dockers would go from minor premiers in 2015 to the worst start from a minor premier in the history of the AFL?</p>
<p>Another question that has been in my mind is based on ladder positions after round 11 - how “set” is the ladder? If my team is currently inside of the top eight what are the chances they will stay?</p>
<p>If they are fifth to eighth what are the chances they will push on and attain a double-chance? If my team is outside the eight, what are the chances of a late run into finals footy like the Tigers in 2014.</p>

<p>Should I be worried if my team is sitting in the top four, what are the chances that we will slip out and lose the double chance?</p>
<p>The news is great if you are a Roos supporter. Only Port, in 2014, has gone from first to not securing the double-chance and only four times since 1996 have the team that was first after 11 rounds not secured two home finals.</p>
<p>The news isn’t too shabby if you are a Swans supporter either, with only Melbourne in 2004 and 2005, falling from second to not secure the double-chance. However, Swans supporters with very short memories will remember that last year they fell from second to fourth costing themselves two home finals and possibly a grand final.</p>
<p>Being an Eagles supporter isn’t terribly great - the best a team has done from seventh is third with only two other teams securing a double-chance from seventh at this point of the season since 1996.</p>

<p>For the Giant new kids on the block the news is surprisingly much better. Six teams have gone from sixth to securing a double chance, with the best being the 2012 Hawks who went from 6th to 1st and then on to losing one of the best grand finals in recent years.</p>
<p>The news isn’t good if you are outside the eight, especially if you are below 13th - only the 13th placed Tigers of 2014 played finals.</p>
<p>The news also isn’t great if you are only as low as ninth, with only five teams since 1996 pushing their way from ninth after round 11 into the finals.</p>
<p>The best ninth to finals group were the 2008 Saints who the Hawks beat by nine goals in a preliminary final.</p>
