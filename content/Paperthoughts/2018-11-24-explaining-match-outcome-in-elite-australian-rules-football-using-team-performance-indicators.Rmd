As a summary, I think the paper is about seeing "box score" data can be used to predict the winner of a game. 

Put another way, if I were to show you the AFL stats on say footywire at the end of a game. I of course covered up the Goals and Behinds as well.

Could you predict who won the game?

The good thing about this paper, is that it only uses data that is already available in [#fitzRoy](https://github.com/jimmyday12/fitzRoy)

# Variables used

```{r}
c("Variables used",
  "Kicks",
  "Marks",
  "Handballs",
  "Tackles",
  "Inside 50s",
  "Clearances",
  "Clangers",
  "Contested possessions",
  "Uncontested possessions",
  "Contested marks",
  "Marks inside 50",
  "Goal conversion",
  "Kick:handball ratio",
  "contested:uncontested possession ratio",
  "disposals",
  "hit outs",
  "Free kick differential")
```

They then removed some variables from the model fitting process. 
For example [Multicollinearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity) is a typical problem in regression. It happens when there is a relationship between your predictor variables. In this case we know that essentially kicks + handballs = disposals which would be an example of multicollinearity. 

# How to get the data ready 

To fit the models described in the paper, we would need a dataset that contains the game information joined with a binary indicator 1 if the team won and 0 if the team lost (in the paper draws were removed).

To do this using [fitzRoy](https://github.com/jimmyday12/fitzRoy) would require joining `fitzRoy::match_results` onto `fitzRoy::player_stats`
