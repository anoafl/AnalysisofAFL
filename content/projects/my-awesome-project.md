## About project

The goal of fitzRoy is to provide a set of functions that allows for users to easily get access to AFL data from sources such as [afltables.com](https://afltables.com/afl/afl_index.html) and [footywire.com](https://www.footywire.com/). There are also tools for processing and cleaning that data. Future versions will include basic [ELO](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/elo-ratings/) processing functions.

It was started by [James Day](https://twitter.com/jamesday87) and I over a beer at a the [old fitzroy hotel](http://www.oldfitzroy.com.au/) which may or may not have been named after the now [defunct AFL team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzroy_Football_Club)
