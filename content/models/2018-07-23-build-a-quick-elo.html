<p>One of my favourite sites is <a href="https://squiggle.com.au">squiggle</a>, mainly because I like to check out what other people have tipped, what their respective margins are and how they are aligned.</p>
<p>As some of you know <a href="https://twitter.com/plusSixOneblog">James</a> and I have been working on an AFL R package called <a href="https://github.com/jimmyday12/fitzRoy">fitzRoy</a></p>
<p>One of our main goals is to get more people to build out AFL models.</p>
<p>For me that’s mainly because I like reading AFL stats content, be it probably a bit too much!</p>
<p>Having done a presentation at <a href="https://user2018.r-project.org">useR</a>, one of the main problems I found with getting people wanting to give it a go is that they feel as though building their own model is simply too complex, that they are out of their depth.</p>
<p>Well I am here to say, that’s not true. Anyone can give it a go.</p>
<p>I think there are many camps to the AFL stats fanbase. One of which I would like to try and include more.</p>
<p>That is those who feel as though they can’t contribute or can’t analyse simply because they don’t know R/How to build out models.</p>
<p>So while you might be reading other blogs and sure they are “coding” it up from “scratch”. I think a missing point to this thought is while that’s true, it also doesn’t have to be you. Lots of people develop packages and answer questions on sites like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r">stackoverflow</a>.</p>
<p>So if you have ever wanted to build your own ELO for AFL why not use this <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/elo/index.html">ELO package</a>. That’s what it was designed for, for people to use it.</p>

<p>So if you run that script end to end you should have a working ELO model that you can play around with.</p>
<div id="somethings-to-note." class="section level1">
<h1>Somethings to note.</h1>
<ul>
<li>This model has no HGA, yes you read that right! <code>HGA &lt;- 0</code> its set to 0 here!</li>
<li>No mean reversion between seasons! <code>carryOver &lt;- 1</code> I think thats right?</li>
<li>I set k=20 for no reason other than I read this blog post here <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/introducing-nfl-elo-ratings/">538 ELO</a>, is that the best way to decide? What would you do differently?</li>
</ul>
