Blogs called analysis of AFL, expect analysis of AFL.


Just an average junior footballer who gave up a not so promising AFL career and instead embarked on a statistical adventure. After chopping and changing majors more than [Scott Cummings](http://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/S/Scott_Cummings.html) changed AFL teams, I ended up doing honours in statistics. Now after working in banking and pharmaceuticals I am doing a PhD in statistics at [UNSW under David Warton](http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~dwarton/).

Strongly influenced by [Turkington](https://www.amazon.com/Instrumental-Variables-Econometric-Society-Monographs/dp/0521385822%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJRRWTH346WSPOAFQ%26tag%3Dprabook0b-20%26linkCode%3Dsp1%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0521385822), [Fisher](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/library/special/mss/fisher/), [Murray](http://www.web.uwa.edu.au/person/kevin.murray) and [Turlach](http://staffhome.ecm.uwa.edu.au/~00043886/).

Prefers GLM to machine learning.
