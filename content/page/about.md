Blogs called analysis of AFL, expect analysis of AFL.


Just an average junior footballer who gave up a not so promising AFL career and instead embarked on a statistical adventure. After chopping and changing majors more than [Scott Cummings](http://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/S/Scott_Cummings.html) changed AFL teams, I ended up doing honours in statistics. Now after working in banking and pharmaceuticals I am doing a PhD in statistics at [UNSW under David Warton](http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~dwarton/).


Prefers GLM to machine learning.

Love a [beer](https://littlecreatures.com.au/agegate/), [wine](https://www.fourthwavewine.com.au/takeittothegrave-home) and unexplained variation.

Analysis and writing done while listening to [dark side of the moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI67GAQYsRc)
