# Using fitzRoy and the tidyverse

```{r}
library(fitzRoy)
library(tidyverse)
```

So what we did before, was we created 3 variables from afltables about Tony Lockett. They were Year (afl season), GM (totals games played in afl season) and GL (total goals kicked in season).  

These are summary statistics i.e. the year summaries (totals) of games played and goals kicked. 

Something you might have noticed with `fitzRoy` is that the afldata is stored as game by game data and not season summaries.
