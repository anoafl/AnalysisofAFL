Each week [triplemfooty](https://twitter.com/triplemfooty/status/1011093422608867329) tweets out a free kick ladder that is based only on total free kick differential throughout the season. 

But what if we did a ladder in the same style of the home and away ladder. 

* 4 points for a win (winning free kick count in game)
* 2 points for a draw (drawn free kick count in game)
* 0 points for a loss (losing the free kick count in game)
* percentage which is $100 * (totalfreesfor/totalfreesagainst)$

Well thankfully to the new afl R package [fitzRoy](https://github.com/jimmyday12/fitzRoy) that is possible!


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
fitzRoy::get_footywire_stats(9514:9630)%>%
    group_by(Round, Team)%>%
  mutate(Free_diff=sum(FF)-sum(FA), 
  sumFF=sum(FF), sumFA=sum(FA))%>%
  select(Team, sumFF, sumFA, Free_diff)%>%
  distinct()%>%
  mutate(points=if_else(Free_diff>0,4,if_else(Free_diff==0,2,0)))%>%
  group_by(Team)%>%
  summarise(total_points=sum(points),
  percentage_Frees=100*(sum(sumFF)/sum(sumFA)))%>%
  arrange(desc(total_points), desc(percentage_Frees))

```
