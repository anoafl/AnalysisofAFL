<h1>Using fitzRoy and the tidyverse</h1>
<pre class="r"><code>library(fitzRoy)
library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## -- Attaching packages ----------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.2.1 --</code></pre>

<p>So what we did before, was we created 3 variables from afltables about Tony Lockett. They were Year (afl season), GM (totals games played in afl season) and GL (total goals kicked in season).</p>
<p>These are summary statistics i.e.Â the year summaries (totals) of games played and goals kicked.</p>
<p>Something you might have noticed with <code>fitzRoy</code> is that the afldata is stored as game by game data and not season summaries.</p>
