<p>Why might having a one pager be handy.</p>
<ul>
<li>You might be really into fantasy sports so want to keep information like points given up by position handy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lets say you are playing a mate in your favourite fantasy league, having information like points given up by a team to a position tends to be handy. It’s nothing new, in fact fantasy sports is big in the US and a site like <a href="https://www.rotowire.com/basketball/opp-avg.php">rotowire</a> provides this information for fans quickly.</p>
<ul>
<li>You might like constructing your own ladders to like a <a href="https://twitter.com/triplemfooty/status/1011093422608867329">free kick count</a> ladder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe you like to debate among your mates, maybe you work for a club and want to know where your team sits every week.</p>
<ul>
<li>You might be a punter so having information like <a href="https://twitter.com/matterofstats?lang=en">Tony</a> presents over in his <a href="http://www.matterofstats.com/mafl-team-dashboards/matterofstats-2018-team-dashboard-for-round-23">matterofstats</a> might inform your betting strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>No matter the purpose, information is key. But its more than just having the information available. You can construct a lot of the above but it would be very time consuming and probably a bit overwhelming. But that’s why <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesday87">James Day</a> and I have gotten <a href="https://github.com/jimmyday12/fitzRoy">fitzRoy</a> together so all of these things are relatively quick, easy and can be updated weekly.</p>
