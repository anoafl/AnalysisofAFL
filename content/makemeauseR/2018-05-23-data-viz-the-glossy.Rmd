One of the fun things when doing graphs, is that moment when you identify something that sticks out. A great example of this is done by [@ethan_meldrum](https://twitter.com/ethan_meldrum/status/991988146215632896)

In it we can see how much Paul Seedsman 2018 has stood out so far. Lets give it the ggplot/fitzRoy treatment. 

# Step One - Get the Data

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(fitzRoy)
library(tidyverse)

df<-fitzRoy::player_stats

df1<-fitzRoy::get_footywire_stats(9514:9593)
df<-df%>%filter(Season != 2018)
df2<-rbind(df, df1)

df2%>%select(Season,TO, MG, Player) %>%
  filter(Season==2018) %>%
  group_by(Player)%>%
  summarise(Turnovers=sum(TO), Meters_gained=sum(MG)) 


```

# Step 2

This is an assumption we are making here that we know the players we want to highlight. But lets say we do and the players are Rory Laird, Bryce Gibbs, Paul Seedsman and Tom Mitchell. We need to create a flag for them so we can subset them out for highlighting down the track. 

We do this using the `mutate`. 

` mutate(flag = ifelse(Player %in% c("Rory Laird","Bryce Gibbs",Paul Seedsman","Tom Mitchell"), T, F))`

Lets break this down

* step a create a variable called flag `flag=`
* step b `ifelse(Player %in% c("P1", "P2"))` if Player is in this list (c("P1", P2)) 
* step c , Give value T otherwise give value F `,T,F))`
                                               

```{r , eval=FALSE}

df2%>%select(Season,TO, MG, Player) %>%
  filter(Season==2018) %>%
  group_by(Player)%>%
  summarise(Turnovers=sum(TO), Meters_gained=sum(MG)) %>%
  mutate(flag = ifelse(Player %in% c("Rory Laird",
                                               "Bryce Gibbs",
                                               "Paul Seedsman", 
                                               "Tom Mitchell"), T, F)) 
```


# Step 3 - Give it the ggplot treatment

```{r, eval=FALSE}
 ggplot(aes(x=Meters_gained, y=Turnovers)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour=flag), show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(method='lm',formula=y~x) +
  geom_text(aes(label=ifelse(Player %in% c ("Rory Laird", 
                                            "Bryce Gibbs",
                                            "Paul Seedsman", 
                                            "Tom Mitchell"), 
                             Player, ""),vjust=-1))
```

* 1 `ggplot(aes(x=Meters_gained, y=Turnovers))` creates a blank canvas with our x variable being `Meters_gained` and y being `Turnovers`
* 2 `geom_point(aes(colour=flag), show.legend=FALSE)` this creates our graph dots we are taking the xy from ggplot and using `aes(colour=flag)` to give our points different colours depending on the value of `flag`
* 3 `geom_smooth(method=lm, formula=y~x)` this gives us our line of best fit (linear regression `method=lm`) 
* 4 `geom_text` this gives us our labels, but we don't want all the players so we subset the labels. We do this using another `ifelse` 
* 5 you can think of the ifelse as *if the Player is in this list , give them label of Player, otherwise blank ""*

* 5a where `Player` is the list of all Players, checking if any player is in this list `c ("Rory Laird","Bryce Gibbs", "Paul Seedsman", "Tom Mitchell")  ` and if they are give them their original label `Player` otherwise a blank label `" "`
* 5b `vjust` moves the labels so not directly over the dot


# Put it all together

```{r}

library(fitzRoy)
library(tidyverse)

df<-fitzRoy::player_stats

df1<-fitzRoy::get_footywire_stats(9514:9593)
df<-df%>%filter(Season != 2018)
df2<-rbind(df, df1)

df2%>%select(Season,TO, MG, Player) %>%
  filter(Season==2018) %>%
  group_by(Player)%>%
  summarise(Turnovers=sum(TO), Meters_gained=sum(MG)) %>%
  mutate(flag = ifelse(Player %in% c("Rory Laird",
                                     "Bryce Gibbs",
                                     "Paul Seedsman", 
                                   "Tom Mitchell"), T, F))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Meters_gained, y=Turnovers)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour=flag), show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(method='lm',formula=y~x) +
  geom_text(aes(label=ifelse(Player %in% c ("Rory Laird", 
                                            "Bryce Gibbs",
                                            "Paul Seedsman", 
                                            "Tom Mitchell"), 
                             Player, ""),vjust=-1))
