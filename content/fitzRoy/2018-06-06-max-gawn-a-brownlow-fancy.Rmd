This week in AFL Nathan Fyfe one of the brownlow favourites got rubbed out for an [ear tickler to Levi Greenwood](https://twitter.com/AFL/status/1003170937812893696)

When looking at the Brownlow odds, its a bit surprising to see Max Gawn listed as the second favourite. While he is having a great season, historically Ruckman have not polled well. But is Max having a Brownlow worthy year?

One way to think about Max, is to compare him to his best every year, which I think personally was his [2016 year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_All-Australian_team) in which he was named in the All-Australian team. 

Visually how can we compare his 2016 season to his 2018 season so far?

One way to do this is to look at a cleveland dot plot

This is something you see quite a bit of online when people are trying to compare many things but split by a factor. 
So in our case for this blog post, we are trying to compare many things (various Max Gawn statistics) split by factor (season 2016, 2018)

So how is Max going in 2018 compared to 2016, lets use this dotplots to visualise this. 

# Step 1 - Get the Data

Luckily we know we are using player level data and thankfully the great people over at [footywire](https://www.footywire.com/afl/footy/ft_match_statistics?mid=9604) have collected stats that include meters gained (MG), intercepts (ITC) and a host of other things. 


```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(fitzRoy)
df<-fitzRoy::player_stats
df<-df%>%
  filter(Season != 2018) #filters out the 2018 data (incomeplete that was downloaded when installing fitzRoy for first time) 
df1<-fitzRoy::get_footywire_stats(9514:9611) #(end round 11)


df2<-rbind(df, df1) #stacks the datasets on top of each other

```

# Step 2 - Filter out Max Gawn and his 2016, 2018 Seasons

```{r}


df3<-df2%>%
  filter(Season %in% c(2016,2018))%>%
  filter(Player =="Max Gawn") 
```

# Step 3 - Summarise Max Gawns averages for each season

```{r}
df3<-df2%>%
  filter(Season %in% c(2016,2018))%>%
  filter(Player =="Max Gawn") %>%
  group_by(Season)%>%
  summarise(ave.ho=mean(HO),
            ave.CM=mean(CM),
            ave.SC=mean(SC),
            ave.MG=mean(MG),
            ave.ITC=mean(ITC), 
            ave.AF=mean(AF),
            ave.SC=mean(SC),
            ave.Mi5=mean(MI5))


```

# Step 4 - Go from wide to long data

```{r}

df4<-gather(df3,variables, values, -Season)   


```

# Step 5 - Give it the ggplot2 treatment

```{r}
df4%>%   
  ggplot(aes(x=values, y=variables)) +geom_point(aes(colour=Season))

```

# Step 6 - Change colour to a factor, add in a `connecter line`

```{r}
df4%>%   
  ggplot(aes(x=values, y=variables)) +geom_point(aes(colour=as.factor(df4$Season)))+ geom_line(aes(group = variables))

```
