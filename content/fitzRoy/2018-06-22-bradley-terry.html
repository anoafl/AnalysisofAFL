<p>You might be reading other sites and see lots of posts on <a href="https://thearcfooty.com/2016/12/29/introducing-the-arcs-ratings-system/">ELO</a> <a href="http://figuringfooty.com/2015/10/09/the-simpelo-team-ratings/">models</a> this post isn’t about building an ELO model yourself that’s another post. This post is about how to apply [Bradley Terry] models for AFL</p>
<div id="why-bother" class="section level1">
<h1>Why Bother?</h1>
<p>Each of the 18 footy teams plays 22 games a year, we can see who has played who and who won each game. We could just use the <a href="http://www.afl.com.au/ladder">AFL ladder</a> but each team doesn’t play each other equally some teams have have easier <a href="http://www.matterofstats.com/mafl-stats-journal/2016/10/27/an-analysis-of-strength-of-schedule-for-the-2018-fixture">schedules</a> than others. What strength of shedule means is that we can’t use the ladder as the best measure of teams as some times might have a worse win/loss record but simply have had a tougher draw than opposing teams who might have had it a lot easier.</p>
<p>A model based approach can help address this problem.</p>

<div id="introducing-bradley-terry" class="section level1">
<h1>Introducing Bradley Terry</h1>
<p>A simple Bradley Terry model treats outcomes of games as an independent Bernoulli random variable with a Bernoulli distribution <span class="math inline">\(p_{ij}\)</span></p>
<p>The log odds corresponding to the probability <span class="math inline">\(p_{ij}\)</span> that team i beats team j is</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(log\frac{p_{ij}}{1-p_{ij}} = \beta{i} - \beta{j}\)</span></p>
<p>The problem is that this is over-parametized which means that its exactly the same if we were to add a fixed constant to all the values of <span class="math inline">\(\beta{i}\)</span> this is a common issue when rating teams and why sometimes you might see a base team being set. For example if we made it such that $_{Adelaide} =0 $ this means that for every other team <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{j}\)</span> represents the log odds of beating adelaide.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-about-hga" class="section level1">
<h1>What about HGA</h1>
<p>The model as it stands now doesn’t have home ground advantage. We can incorporate that by including an intercept term <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(log\frac{p_{ij}}{1-p_{ij}} = \alpha + \beta{i} - \beta{j}\)</span></p>
<p>By rearranging the equation we can see how it increases the log-odds of the home team winning by a constant <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span></p>
